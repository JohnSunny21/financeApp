## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This project is built on a modern **microservice architecture**. This design separates concerns, improves scalability, and allows for the use of the best technology for each specific task (Java for the robust backend, Python for data science).

![A simple architecture diagram.](screenshots/FinTrack.drawio.png)

- **React Frontend**: A client-side application built with React and served via a lightweight Nginx server. It is responsible for the entire user interface.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: The core of the application. This robust REST API handles user authentication, business logic, and data persistence. It acts as an orchestrator, fetching data from the database and delegating analysis tasks to the ML service.
- **Python ML Service**: A specialized Flask microservice that exposes a single endpoint for data analysis. It receives transaction data, performs K-Means clustering, and returns structured insights.
- **MySQL Database**: The persistent storage layer for all user and transaction data.

## üöÄ Running Locally with Docker

This entire application stack can be built and run with a single command, thanks to Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- A `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`)

### Steps

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
  cd [YourRepoName]
```

#### Create your environment file:
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your secrets:

**.env**
```env
DB_PASSWORD=your_super_secret_database_password
JWT_SECRET=your_long_and_random_jwt_secret_key
SPRING_DATABASE_URL=your_spring_database_url
DB_USERNAME=your_super_database_username
ML_URL=your_customized_ml_url
```

#### Build and run the application:
```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

#### Access the application:
- **Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8282`

The application will start with all services networked and configured to work together.

## üí° What I Learned
Building this project was a fantastic learning experience that solidified my skills across the full development lifecycle:

- **Complex Backend Architecture:** I learned to design and build a secure, stateless REST API with Spring Boot, implementing token-based authentication (JWT) and advanced, dynamic querying with the JPA Criteria API.
- **Microservice Integration:** I gained hands-on experience in building and orchestrating a multi-service application, making a Java backend communicate seamlessly with a Python service.
- **Practical Machine Learning:** I moved beyond theory and implemented an end-to-end unsupervised learning pipeline, including feature engineering, model tuning (Elbow Method), and, most importantly, interpreting the model's output into user-friendly insights.
- **Professional Frontend Development:** I built a responsive, interactive, and themeable UI in React, managing complex state and asynchronous operations.
- **DevOps & Containerization:** I learned to containerize a multi-language application using Docker and orchestrate the entire stack with Docker Compose, creating a portable and reproducible development environment.
